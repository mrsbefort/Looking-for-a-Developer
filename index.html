            A true developer is more than a job or a position it’s who you are. 
            I love coming up with ideas and seeing how things come together. 
            I love working in teams and towards a common goal. 
            I love creating and being a part of the solution. 
            What you get with me is all of my: skills, qualities, values, interests, 
            academic knowledge, work and life experiences.

        <p>
            I'm originally born and raised in Virginia Beach. The state slogan, Virginia is for Lovers, represents love for anything. From sandy beaches to mountainous terrain. As a girl, I frequently disassembled electronics out of curiosity. There were many days creating robots out of shoeboxes and random materials laying around the house. Fast forward to my senior year of high school. My favorite teacher, Mrs. Goodwin, ask the class to think about what they wanted to be. My top interest was the design of futuristic cars. I asked her what are the people that do those sorts of things called. With a sweet smile on her face, she replied Mechanical Engineers. 
Four years later, I complete my Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the illustrious North Carolina A&T State University. My first role out of college was working in the heavy equipment industry. Simultaneously, I was asked to become the head coach for an all-girls high school FIRST robotics team. 
2020 has been described by many words. My word would be Love squared! I couldn't end this without mentioning my whys. I am a twin mom of one year old boy girl toddlers. I currently do contract work for Volvo Truck while completing a Full Stack Developer Bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill. I LOVE^2 it all! ☮
